This is a Hollow Knight mod reupload with one simple edit - making the sprite half the size - as I found it to be a little too big for my liking when playing.

As I did not want to take any credit away from the official creators <strong>jngo102</strong> & <strong>ValancedBreakfast</strong>, I will only upload the dll.

Current reupload by Valanced Breakfast: <a href="https://github.com/ValancedBreakfast/DamageValuesRewritten" https://github.com/ValancedBreakfast/DamageValuesRewritten</a>

### Installation
1. Download Lumafly and install the original mod 'DamageValuesRewritten' (Note the lack of spaces in the name).
2. Go into the Hollow Knight local install folder. To find this on steam, right click the game, click 'manage' & 'browse local files'.
3. Find the mod folder. This is found in 'Hollow Knight_Data\Managed\Mods\DamageValuesRewritten'
4. Place the .dll file from this repository into that folder and - when prompted - replace.
5. That's it!
